I created the "RunAll" script for you to open in idle and ctrl+f5

It should run all the required scripts then my "ReadableMatricesScript" to make the matrices more legible (the .txt we had to make are hard to look at due to how numpy's savetxt method works.

You can delete the bstamper txt files to prove that they are created from the script.
