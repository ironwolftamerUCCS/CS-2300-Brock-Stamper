MatrixManipulator: Script to perform various matrix manipulations and calculations

function Print2DMatrix (a 2D matrix)
	iterates through each row printing out the number in each column of the row and prints a white space between the columns

function SolveMatrixEquation (A (2x2 matrix), b (2x1 matrix)) : solve the equation Ax=b for x

	Instantiate matrices for later

	if bottom left of a is not 0
		set the shear using -a11/a21 for bottom left, set rest according to the indentity matrix
		multiply the shear onto A and B using MatrixMultiplier2D

	if bottom right of a is 0
		if b2 is 0
			print out "infinite solutions" to user

		else
			print out "no solutions" to user
	
		exit the function
		
	else if the top right is not 0
		Set the shear using -a12/a22 for the top right, set rest according to the indentity matrix
		multiply the shear onto A and B using the MatrixMultiplier2D

	
	solve for x1 by dividing b1 by a11
	solve for x2 by dividing b2 by a22
	print out solution

function MatrixMultiplier2D (2 2D matrices)

	Instantiate output
	Support for the loop

	Start at each row of the first matrix and save each column value in a list
	Take each column of the second matrix and save each row value in a list

	loop through and add together the multiples of the same positions in each of the two aformentioned lists and save it to the appropriate place in the output matrix
	reset the column list of the second matrix and go back and save the next column into the list

	when all the columns of the second matrix are saved and mulitplied by the rows of the first matrix reset the row list and go back 2 steps
	when all the rows of the first matrix are used return the new matrix

SolveEigenThings (A (2x2 matrix)) : Solves for eigenvalues, the eigenvector, R, and computes RΛRT

	Declare matrices for later

	Solve for e1 and e2
Check if inside of square root of quadratic equation greater than or equal to 0
Declare insideOfQuadratric and set it equal to (a11 * a22)^2 – 4(a11 * a22 – a12 * a21)
If insideOfQuadratic is less than 0
	No real eigen values
else
	Compute e1 and e2
	e1 equals negated a11 * a22 plus insideOfQuadratic all divided by 2
	e2 equals negated a11 * a22 minus insideOfQuadratic all divided by 2
